        Sinkholes are a common feature of Florida's landscape. They are only one
        of many kinds of karst landforms, which include caves, disappearing
        streams, springs, and underground drainage systems, all of which occur
        in Florida. Karst is a generic term which refers to the characteristic
        terrain produced by erosional processes associated with the chemical
        weathering and dissolution of limestone or dolomite, the two most common
        carbonate rocks in Florida. Dissolution of carbonate rocks begins when
        they are exposed to acidic water. Most rainwater is slightly acidic and
        usually becomes more acidic as it moves through decaying plant debris.
